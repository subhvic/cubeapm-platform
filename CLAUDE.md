# CubeAPM Platform — Claude Code Context

## What this is
CubeAPM is an open-source application performance monitoring (APM) platform. This repo is the **redesigned frontend** — a ground-up rebuild of the UI layer, keeping the same backend/API. The redesign was driven by a comprehensive UX teardown of both CubeAPM and New Relic, and a detailed benchmark analysis.

## Tech stack
- **Vite + React 18 + Tailwind CSS 3**
- **React Router 6** for client-side routing
- **Recharts** for time series charts (install with `npm install`)
- **Lucide React** for icons (24x24, stroke-based, always paired with text labels)
- **clsx** for conditional classnames
- Path alias: `@/` → `src/`

## Getting started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev   # runs on localhost:3000
```

## Architecture

### App shell
`AppShell.jsx` is a flex row: fixed-width sidebar + flex-1 main area. Main has a transparent header on the canvas gutter, and one large surface card (`bg-card`, `rounded-card`) that everything lives inside. This "one floating card" pattern is the core layout — don't introduce a second card-on-canvas pattern.

### Routing
All routes are children of `<AppShell />` via `<Outlet />`:
- `/` → HomePage (services dashboard)
- `/traces` → TracesPage
- `/logs` → LogsPage  
- `/metrics` → MetricsPage
- `/alerts` → AlertsPage
- `/settings` → SettingsPage

Disabled nav items (Service Graph, SLOs, Synthetic Monitors, Infrastructure) are stubbed in the sidebar with `opacity-.42` and no click handler.

### Data layer
Static mock data in `src/data/`. Every service has RED metrics (Rate, Error, Duration) computed through status resolution functions. Replace with real API calls when integrating with the CubeAPM backend.

## Design system — non-negotiable rules

### 1. Status colors are NEVER hardcoded
Every status dot, badge, KPI value, health block, and graph node resolves color through `statusForLatency()`, `statusForErrorRate()`, or `worstStatus()` in `src/utils/status.js`. Never write a raw hex for a status color — always go through the status functions.

### 2. Status colors must NEVER appear in chart series palettes
A line's color in a multi-series chart identifies *which thing it is*, not *how severe it is*. Use the chart palette (blues, purples, teals) for series identity. Red/amber/green are reserved exclusively for severity.

### 3. Services sort by severity, not alphabetically
The Home page service list and any service selector must sort critical → warning → healthy. Alphabetical sorting was the #1 UX finding — it buries incidents.

### 4. No icon-only controls without labels
Every icon-bearing interactive element must have a visible text label or `title`/`aria-label`. The current CubeAPM has 14 unlabeled sidebar icons — this was the #2 UX finding.

### 5. Auto-load data, never "click Search to see anything"
Logs and Traces pages must auto-run the default query on mount. The current CubeAPM shows a blank screen with a Search button — this is the #3 UX finding.

### 6. Comparison context on every metric
"612ms" alone is meaningless. Always show the delta vs. previous period where the data supports it. This is the "smarter, not prettier" principle.

## Color tokens (dark mode — the only mode built so far)

### Surfaces
| Token | Hex | Tailwind class |
|---|---|---|
| Canvas (gutter) | `#151820` | `bg-canvas` |
| Card (surface) | `#080B11` | `bg-card` |
| Panel | `#171C28` | `bg-panel` |
| Panel hover | `#1B2130` | `bg-panel-2` |
| Raised (popovers) | `#1E2431` | `bg-raised` |

Note: canvas is MID-TONE, card is DARKER — intentionally inverted for floating-card effect.

### Borders
| Subtle | `#232B3B` | `border-border-subtle` |
| Panel | `#2A3346` | `border-border-panel` |  
| Strong | `#39445C` | `border-border-strong` |

### Text
| Primary | `#F1F3F9` | `text-text-primary` |
| Secondary | `#9CA6BF` | `text-text-secondary` |
| Muted | `#616C86` | `text-text-muted` |

### Brand
| Brand | `#3B82F6` | `text-brand` / `bg-brand` |
| Brand muted | `#182A4E` | `bg-brand-muted` |

### Semantic status
| Healthy | `#22C55E` | `.status-healthy` / `bg-status-healthy` |
| Warning | `#F59E0B` | `.status-warning` / `bg-status-warning` |
| Critical | `#EF4444` | `.status-critical` / `bg-status-critical` |
| Info | `#60A5FA` | `.status-info` / `bg-status-info` |

## Typography
- **UI text:** Inter, 13px/1.45 body default
- **Numerals/code:** JetBrains Mono — KPI values, trace IDs, table numerics
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` set globally

## Component patterns

### Shared components (in `src/components/shared/`)
- **Panel** — card with header row, used for every data section
- **DataTable** — sortable, right-aligned numerics, status-colored cells
- **TabBar** — compact pill tabs, one pattern everywhere
- **KpiCard** — label + status chip + mono value + sparkline + threshold
- **StatusDot** / **StatusBadge** — always resolve through status utils
- **IncidentBanner** — left-border severity accent, surfaces root cause prominently
- **EmptyState** — icon + title + description + action

### Layout components (in `src/components/layout/`)
- **AppShell** — flex row layout wrapper
- **Sidebar** — grouped nav (Workspace/Analyze/Manage), collapse/expand
- **Header** — page title, search, time range, controls
- **Logo** — inline SVG brand assets (icon + wordmark)

## Key research findings driving this design
1. Current CubeAPM sorts services alphabetically → incidents get buried
2. All KPI cards render the same green → no severity signal
3. 14 sidebar icons with no text labels → high cognitive load
4. Logs/Traces show blank screen until user clicks Search → data exists but isn't surfaced
5. No incident banner → root cause is hidden in nested views
6. Infrastructure Correlation is CubeAPM's most unique feature but rendered as a generic table
7. No comparison context on metrics → "612ms" means nothing without "↑4.4× vs last hour"

## Files NOT to edit without understanding context
- `src/utils/status.js` — status resolution logic, load-bearing for the entire UI
- `tailwind.config.js` — all design tokens live here, matched to the style guide
- `src/data/` — mock data, intentionally includes one critical service (order-service) to demonstrate severity-driven sorting and incident banners
